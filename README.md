Hello! My name is Fernando Aguilar (aka. WhiteWolf or Fach64). Brand new to GitHub!

I'm currently working as a SOC analyst (blueteam).

With 1 year of experience as a SOC Analyst L1, my expertise lies in investigating and assessing cyber threats and security alerts,
conducting full security incident investigations, and delivering comprehensive reports. Additionally, I help to generate and implement playbooks for various 
use cases, demonstrating my proactive approach and commitment to streamlining processes.

Passionate about pentesting and hacking, I bring an assertive mindset and unwavering dedication to ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information in the ever-evolving 
cybersecurity landscape.

The goal of creating this GitHub is to upload personal tools I am creating in order to automate simple task for analysis and investigation, data gathering, threaht hunting and others.

I hope all the tools you find in this repository are helpful to you and your team. Happy hunting! üê∫
